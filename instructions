 * This text includes usage of the program, rules of the game and
 * functionalities implemented in the game, program structure.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This tetris game can be starting by pressing Start button in the ui. After
 * pressing start button, tetrominos automatically fall downwards. Keys 'A',
 * 'S', 'D' can be used to move falling tetrominos to move them to left, down
 * and right respectively. Pressing 'S' makes the tetrominos fall faster. Quit
 * button can pressed anytime to close the program. Start button is disabled
 * during the game. Player can give their username before starting the game.
 * Points earned and time elapsed are also shown updated in the game. Once a
 * game is over new game can be started by pressing start button again.
 *
 * Rules of game:
 * Player can move tetromino horizontally and vertically downwards. Tetrominos
 * fall automatically randomly. Moving tetrominos outside the game area and over
 * another tetromino is illegal. Once a tetromino lands at the bottom of game area or
 * on a old tetromino, the tetromino cannot be moved further anymore. New
 * tetromino starts falling then. Points are awarded based on the number of
 * tetrominos that have fallen. 1 tetromino = 1 point. Half tetromino at the end
 * is not counted. Tetrominos cannot be rotated. When tetrominos fill the game
 * area and don't have place to further move downwards, the game ends. Every
 * new tetromino after one has faster speed until it reaches a constant speed.
 *
 * Functionalities implemented:
 * 1. All minimal requirements.
 * 2. All seven different tetrominos have been implemented.
 * 3. Time used so far shown during the game in seconds elapsed.
 * 4. Points are counted based on number of fallen tetrominos and displayed to
 *    user.
 * 5. Tetrominos fall quicker when the game advances.
 * 6. After the game ends, it is possible to start the game again from the
 *    beginning without starting the program again.
 * 7. Points earned by player are stored in a file with their names and time
 *    taken during the game.
 * 8. The falling tetromino can be moved simultaneously as down as possible
 *    with a key 'S'.
 *
 * Program structure and design:
 * Mainwindow handles all the processes. For each tetromino, whether the move
 * is legal or not is checked by coordinates of game area and old tetrominos.
 * Tetromino can move only if move is legal. Two timers are used for maintaining
 * speed of tetromino and time elapsed. New tetromino is created at random position in x axis
 * once old one have nowhere to move downwards anymore. Points are also added at this time.
 * If a tetromino has nowhere to move and is partially or fully out of game area
 * the game ends.
